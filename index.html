                <h4>ABOUT ME</h4 >
               
                <br>
                <p>I have been a musician for the majority of my life. I was raised homeschooled in a rural Georgia, and have two older siblings. My sister is a scientist, my brother an engineer, and myself a professional musician. One year for christmas, I asked my parents for an electric guitar for my birthday. So when I turned 6, I got my first guitar. Iâ€™m not sure when I had decided that I wanted to pursue music, I believe it was just subconsciously placed in my head through the records my dad used to play in the car when we were going anywhere.  I now play guitar, drums, piano, and I sing. I play in multiple bands, write songs, and work in a recording studio. 
                    <br>
                    <br>

As far as my education goes, I was homeschooled, then attended a public high school, then attended the University of North Georgia. I studied Spanish, English, Math and Business classes, before I was able to transfer to UGA. This past summer, I studied abroad in Spain. I was able to learn Spanish and practice music and learn about Spanish Culture. I had a great time listening to new Spanish music and making friends from other countries. I even made some friends that I still talk to regularly now, four months later. That was my final experience at the University of North Georgia. This fall 2017 semester is my first semester here at UGA. At UGA I now study music business and Computer Science and Accounting. I am very excited to continue my education at UGA and learn about computing, business and music.

I've worked in restaurants most of my life as well. My first job was in a pizza shop when I was 16. Then I scooped ice cream, and continued serving in different restaurants through highschool and college. I eventually landed a job as a chef in a local produce store and restaurant, where I worked full time during the summers and part time during the semesters to pay for college. I am very proud of myself for putting myself through school, and now I have a love for cooking as well.</p>
